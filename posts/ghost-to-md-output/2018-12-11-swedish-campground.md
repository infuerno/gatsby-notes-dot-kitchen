Mac OS modifier keys always seem to confuse me. 

I can never work out if ⌥ means the control key or the alt/option key. Upon reading [this blog post on Mac OS X Modifier Key Symbols](http://irreal.org/blog/?p=121), it became more obvious that it **must be the alt/option key** since everything else is relatively obvious. Even the command key, ⌘, is now ubiquitous despite its [Swedish campground origins](http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Swedish_Campground.txt).
