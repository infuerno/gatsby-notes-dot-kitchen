### Lists

Bullets

- Use *italics*
- Use **bold**
- A nested item

- A final item

Numbers

1. Remember to buy some milk
2. Drink the milk
3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it

### Links

URLs are automatically linked e.g. [http://ghost.org](http://ghost.org)

Or more commonly use `[]()` e.g. [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org).

### Images

If you have already uploaded the file use `![]()` e.g.

![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)

To show the WYSIWYG features in the right hand page use `![]` e.g.

![A bowl of bananas]

### Quoting

Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!

### Working with Code

Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.

.awesome-thing {

display: block;

width: 100%;

}

### Ready for a Break?

Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.

### Advanced Usage

There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.

That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)
