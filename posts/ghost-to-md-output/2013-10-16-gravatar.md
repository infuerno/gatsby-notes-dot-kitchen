I sometimes notice that when I sign up for something I magically get assigned my clockwork orange eye icon.

Gravatar (linked to Wordpress somehow?) simply links an image to an email address and can be served up using the MD5 hash of the email address.

The ruby code to generate the url is:

    require 'digest/md5'
    gravatar_image = "http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/#{Digest::MD5.hexdigest('example@gmail.com')}"
    

Mine is: `http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2fd7b1867f23b89d9ed1b0bfcbc85a82`.
