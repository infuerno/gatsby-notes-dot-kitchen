The image pasting functionality in Atlassian's [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) rocks!

Screenshot an area of the screen to the clipboard using something like [Greenshot](http://getgreenshot.org/) and paste it straight into an article or blog post. It is automatically resized to a default size, but you can return it to the original, or drag the corners to any size you want.

Windows + Greenshot + Confluence.

I'm on a quest to find a similar kind of workflow for Mac OSX and Ghost.
