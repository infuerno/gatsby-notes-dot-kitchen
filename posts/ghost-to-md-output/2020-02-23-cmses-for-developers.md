I probably compiled this list when Ghost v2 came out and I had to start using markdown "cards" (a la Wordpress). Not sure where I gathered this list from. Could be worth a look ...

- [http://wardrobecms.com/](http://wardrobecms.com/) - doesn't look like its available yet
- [http://logdown.com/](http://logdown.com/) - the missing blogging platform for hackers. By the look of the [hot this week](https://logdown.com/explore/week) list, there is a lot of people publishing about Trump on this platform. Maybe not this one.
- [https://www.silvrback.com/](https://www.silvrback.com/) and this post: [https://dsowers.silvrback.com/introducing-silvrback](https://dsowers.silvrback.com/introducing-silvrback). All STEM writers feel the good vibe. Lots of messages re a 14 day trial. Hmmm
- [http://codrspace.com/](http://codrspace.com/) - wat no HTTPS ?? Looks dead now anyway ..
