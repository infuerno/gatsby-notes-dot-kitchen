Sometimes, when you’re feeling important,

Sometimes, when your ego’s in bloom,

Sometimes, when you take it for granted

You’re the best qualified in the room.

Sometimes, when you feel that your going

Would leave an unfilled hole,

Just follow this simple instruction,

and see how it humbles your soul:

Take a bucket and fill it with water,

Put your hand in it up to the wrist,

Pull it out and the hole that’s remaining

Is a measure of how you’ll be missed.

You may splash all you please when you enter,

You can stir up the water galore,

But stop, and you’ll find in a minute

That it looks quite the same as before.

The moral of this quaint example

Is to do just the best that you can;

Be proud of yourself, but remember,

There is no indispensable man.(or woman)
